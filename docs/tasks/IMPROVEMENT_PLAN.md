# MCP Screenshot Tool - Improvement Plan

Based on research of best practices for screenshot tools and MCP development, this plan outlines improvements to make the mcp-screenshot project more powerful and useful for AI agents.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Caching for AI Responses ✅
**Priority: HIGH**
**Complexity: LOW**

Implemented caching for AI image descriptions to avoid repeated API calls for the same images.

- Created `core/cache.py` with ImageDescriptionCache class
- Added TTL-based caching with memory and disk persistence
- Integrated caching into description.py with use_cache parameter
- Reduces costs and improves performance

### 2. Screenshot Comparison ✅
**Priority: HIGH**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Implemented visual comparison functionality to detect changes between screenshots.

- Created `core/compare.py` with image comparison algorithms
- Calculates similarity scores and generates diff visualizations
- Added compare command to CLI
- Added compare_images tool to MCP

### 3. MCP Prompts for Common Agent Tasks ✅
**Priority: HIGH**
**Complexity: LOW**

Created pre-configured prompts for typical screenshot analysis tasks.

- Created `mcp/prompts.py` with 10 prompt templates
- Includes UI verification, error detection, form validation, etc.
- Registered prompts with MCP server
- Allows agents to use standardized analysis approaches

### 4. Screenshot Annotation ✅
**Priority: HIGH**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Added ability to annotate screenshots with visual markers.

- Created `core/annotate.py` with annotation functionality
- Supports rectangles, circles, arrows, and text
- Added annotate command to CLI
- Added annotate_image tool to MCP
- Created comprehensive tests

## Remaining Improvements

### 5. OCR/Text Extraction
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Extract text from images using OCR, enabling agents to read UI text directly.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Add pytesseract or easyocr to dependencies
- Create `core/ocr.py` with text extraction functions
- Add extract_text command to CLI
- Add extract_text tool to MCP

### 6. Batch Processing
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Support processing multiple screenshots at once.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `core/batch.py` for batch operations
- Add batch command to CLI with glob pattern support
- Add batch_process tool to MCP
- Support concurrent processing

### 7. MCP Resources
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Expose screenshot history as MCP resources.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create history tracking in core layer
- Expose recent screenshots as MCP resources
- Allow agents to reference previous captures
- Add metadata to resources

### 8. Monitoring and Metrics
**Priority: LOW**
**Complexity: MEDIUM**

Add performance monitoring and usage metrics.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `core/metrics.py` for tracking
- Add timing to all operations
- Track success/failure rates
- Add metrics command to CLI

## Summary

The improvements focus on:
1. **Performance** - Caching and batch processing
2. **Functionality** - Comparison, annotation, OCR
3. **Integration** - MCP prompts and resources
4. **Observability** - Metrics and monitoring

Each improvement follows the three-layer architecture and provides value without adding unnecessary complexity.

**Next Priority**: Implement OCR/Text Extraction to enable agents to read text from screenshots.
